        <h3>Chicken</h3>
            <li>2 Tbsp cooking oil</li>
            <li>1 lb boneless skinless chicken thighs</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp cornstarch</li>
            <li>1 pinch each salt and pepper</li>
        <h3>For Serving</h3>
            <li>4 cups cooked jasmine rice</li>
            <li>2 whole green onions</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>First, prepare the sauce. In a small bowl stir together the soy sauce, 
                water, sesame oil, brown sugar, rice vinegar, fresh ginger, minced garlic, 
                cornstarch, and sesame seeds. (Grate ginger with a small-holed cheese grater). 
                Set the sauce aside.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the egg, 2 Tbsp cornstarch, and a pinch of 
                salt and pepper. Trim any excess fat from the chicken thighs,then cut them 
                into small 1 inch pieces. Toss the chicken in the egg and cornstarch mixture.</li>
            <li>Add the cooking oil to a large skillet and heat it over medium flame. Wait 
                until the skillet is very hot, then swirl the skillet to make sure the oil 
                coats the entire surface. Add the batter coated chicken and spread it out into
                a single layer over the surface of the skillet.</li>
            <li>Allow the chicken pieces to cook, undisturbed, until goden brown on the  
                bottom. Then, carefully flip the chicken. breaking up the pieces into smaller
                clumps as you flip. Continue to cook the chicken until golden brown on the 
                other side. Stir the chicken as little as possible to avoid breaking the egg 
                coating from the surface of the chicken.</li>
            <li>Once the chicken is cooked through and golden brown on all sides, pour the 
                sauce over top. Toss the chicken to coat in the sauce. As the sauce comes up to 
                a simmer, it will begin to thicken. Continue to gently stir the chicken in the 
                sauce until it has thickened, then turn off the heat.</li>
            <li>Serve the chicken over a bed of rice and sprinkle the sliced green onions 
                over top.</li>
